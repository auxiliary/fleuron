Silent and automatic copy and backup of flash drives (Migrated from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fleuron/)

Fleuron is a silent flash drive copier. When a flash drive is connected, Fleuron automatically starts copying the data with a Breadth First Search algorithm. In this way, the root directories are copied first and as time passes, deeper directories are copied. Fleuron also randomly stops for random amounts of seconds to allow the drive to be safely removed and to avoid detection. Fleuron can be used for data backup, flash synchronization and undetectable data copying. 

Note: Currently Fleuron only works on Linux systems.
